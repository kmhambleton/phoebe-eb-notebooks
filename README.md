## Contents of this repository:
This repo contains Jupyter notebooks for fitting eclipsing binaries. They are currently geared towards fitting eclipsing binaries with red giant componets. The notebooks are intended to be used sequentially to generate a binary star model. Included are the data to fit an example binary. To fit a different system, the config file (coming soon) should be updated. 

Below is a list of the status of the notebooks:
- 01 Estimators: almost ready (a small plotting bug in the solution for LC geometry), the inputs should be replaced with a config file.
- 02 Optimizers fast: almost ready and in need of a config file.
- 03 Optimizers with detailed physics: Needs cleaning up.
- 04 Luminosity treatment: Needs cleaning up
- 05 Adding GPs: Needs cleaning up
- 06 Running McMC: Needs cleaning up
- 07 McMC checks: Work in progress


Additionally, there are data files and configuration notebooks.
