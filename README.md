## Contents of this repository:
This repo contains Jupyter notebooks for fitting eclipsing binaries. They are currently geared towards fitting eclipsing binaries with red giant componets. The notebooks are intended to be used sequentially to generate a detailed binary star model. Included are the data to fit an example binary. To fit a different system, the config file (coming soon) should be updated. 

Below is a list of the status of the notebooks:
- 00 Agressive detrending: Needs cleaning up.
- 01 Estimators: almost ready (a small plotting bug in the solution for LC geometry), the inputs should be replaced with a config file.
- 02 Optimizers fast: almost ready and in need of a config file.
- 03 Optimizers with detailed physics: Needs cleaning up.
- 03.5 Less agressive detrending in preparation for the application of Gaussian Processes: Needs cleaning up.
- 04 Luminosity treatment: Needs cleaning up
- 05 Adding GPs: Needs cleaning up
- 06 Running McMC: Needs cleaning up
- 07 Check McMC Progress: Not yet added (too many figures, current size 25 Mb)

The data files for using these notebooks can be found in the data folder.
